I am a bit of a Vagabond, I have what I believe is a fantastic job that allows me to travel pretty much every where. I tend to live in more than one city at a time and then go meet friends somewhere else for fun anyways. I like to cook and I'm getting pretty good at it, but I'm far better at drinking beer and wine. Work takes up most of my time but I don't think I've ever turned down an adventure even if it means hopping on a plane with an hours notice.

Quiet when I need to. Loud when I need to. Never take life too serious...I mean come on we are on Tinder. Make my living being an athlete but that's only a fraction of my life I do lots of other stuff aside from lifting metal or jumping buildings. Umbrella dodging is a great Vancouver sport!  IG

Currently back in school studying Cognitive Science. I like good conversation, spending time outside, going to movies being general nerdy, watching live concerts and shows, and most importantly hanging out with friends, having a ton of laughs. I appreciate someone who knows when it's time to be serious but can have while doing it. Chatting online for ages is not my thing -- I much prefer to meet in person once we establish that we get along. Some people call me weird, I take it as a compliment.
Shiver me Tinder.

There are always a million reasons not to do something; its why we should treasure the people who don't let them stop them from doing what they want.
Not looking for just anyone - I'm looking for someone to captivate me.  A partner in crime and a travel enthusiast. I believe in being open & honest at all times, without games and that chivalry is far from dead. If we wait for the moment when everything, absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin.

HOROSCOPE-CANCER:
The Cancer male can be a moody individual, but is rarely mean-spirited. An exceedingly romantic soul, he is not always confident of his own attractiveness. He possesses a keen understanding of women and likes children. He is kind-hearted but not soft and is truly a one-partner individual. When this man's feelings are hurt, he can sulk privately for days, but is best left alone when low since too much sympathy causes him to brood. The male governed by Cancer is far too deep to sum-up on first acquaintance, although his sense of humor is sure to impress as will his outlook on the world. Still, this is a man who can adopt an air of geniality in order to hide his own sense of inadequacy and insecurity. It takes a long time to get to know the Cancer male. He tends to be subjective in emotional matters and unable to see anything from an objective point of view when he is upset. Yet, he is generous with his affection and desires the same in return, feeling bitterly deprived if such is not forthcoming. This male can be a gallant and amusing sweetheart and/or escort...if he so wishes...but is difficult to pin down. He is prone to avoid a serious relationship for as long as possible and then enter into one with an abundance of trepidation. If he believes he has found the right partner, then he will settle blissfully into a long-term relationship. If he suspects he has chosen incorrectly, then he can be virtually impossible to live with.

If I could be any object in this world with a thought, I would be a mirror. I like to play the devil's advocate and will always have an opposing argument to challenge any point of view. Every perspective has valid points that cannot be said to be 100% true or false and bringing these points to attention is the only thing that can make a conversation interesting.

I'm very easy going, funny, caring and open to trying anything once. I enjoy going to the gym everyday after work and having a healthy lifestyle. I recently have taken up snowboarding and love it. I like spending my time outside especially rides on my motorcycle as well as cuddling up to a movie. Besides the gym I go to a two step class once a week. As for music I like everything but love country. Just looking to meet new people and possibly a girl I want to spoil.
Recently moved to North Van! Have been a city person trapped in the valley for most of my life,  where I became quite introverted!  I now feel that I am finally where I'm supposed to be. And can flourish in my new environment, as the true, free spirited extrovert that I am.

"hard work beats talent, when talents fails to work hard."
"through every dark night, there is a brighter day after that."
"See, to live is to suffer, but to survive... Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering."
"Let me tell you something you already know. The world aint all sunshine and rainbows. Its a very mean and nasty place, and I dont care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it aint about how hard you hit. Its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. Thats how winning is done! Now, if you know what youre worth, then go out and get what youre worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you aint where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that aint you. Youre better than that!"
"Because when you have love for anything, you'll go to the extreme, to maintain that love. That's what love does. Love drives you to do anything to maintain that connection... To be the best at anything, you got to have a certain love for that to make you overcome all the obstacles that's going to be thrown in your way. That's what the game of basketball has been for me."

I'm 24, 6'2", slim/athletic build. I'm kind of old fashioned and I love to spoil people. I listen to a vast array of music, and I sometimes forget I'm not as smart as I think I am :p
I'm shy at first, but I warm up quickly. Also I have a slightly twisted sense of humour
I work as a driver in film. I'm looking for a woman who can make me want to explore new things. I don't drink, but I smoke and 420.
I love stand up comedy.
Sarcasm, craft beer (any lager will do)  terrible humour... Any of the popular character defects would describe me I think..
Lover of coffee & tea beverages, food, travel, and video games.
Ross is definitely the worst friend.
